# Three-phase-inverter_Modification

**Design and implementation of a three-phase inverter with SPWM and SVPWM, prepared for future PMSM control.**

## Background
This project focuses on the continued development and modification of a three-phase DC-to-AC converter, utilizing the Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SV-PWM) algorithm.
The inverter was originally designed and built by a previous bachelor group at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, and later further refined by another group who successfully reduced the physical footprint of the design.

## About the Project

Building upon their work, our bachelor group aimed to prepare the inverter for future implementation of Field Oriented Control (FOC).  
Throughout this project, our primary goal has been to implement current measurement on all three phases and enable encoder input handling for rotor position feedback.
